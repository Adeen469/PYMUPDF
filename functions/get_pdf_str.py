Function: fitz.get_pdf_str
Signature: get_pdf_str(s: str) -> str
Description:
Return a PDF string depending on its coding.

    Notes:
        Returns a string bracketed with either "()" or "<>" for hex values.
        If only ascii then "(original)" is returned, else if only 8 bit chars
        then "(original)" with interspersed octal strings 
nn is returned,
        else a string "<FEFF[hexstring]>" is returned, where [hexstring] is the
        UTF-16BE encoding of the original.
